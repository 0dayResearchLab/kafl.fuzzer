`Note: All components are provided for research and validation purposes only. Use at your own risk.`

kAFL-Fuzzer is a AFL-like fuzzer written in Python. Originally published as just "kAFL"
(and partly updated/rereleased as part of "Redqueen" and "Grimoire" projects) this project
maintains the fuzzer frontend as a separate component for use with the newer
libxdc/Qemu/KVM stack (aka. [Nyx backend](https://nyx-fuzz.com).

For installation, usage and reporting issues, please refer to [kAFL](https://github.com/IntelLabs/kAFL).
